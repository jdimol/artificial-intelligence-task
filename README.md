# Discovering Music Patterns with Enrichment and Analysis of a music Dataset

Discovering Music Patterns in songs is a big task of the MIR (Music Information Retrieval) field. We can use Music Patterns in order to organize large music collections and to enhance performance of various MIR tasks such as genre classification. Our work aims to enrich the Beatles Annotation Dataset using python scripts and description logics axioms. We were able to estimate chord durations and chord degrees for each given chord in each chord progression of a Beatles' song. 

# Knowledge Graph and SPARQL Queries

In order to extract the Music Patterns, we created a repository on GraphDB. There, we imported our ontology and all the Beatles' songs in a RDF format. Now, we are able to perform SPARQL Queries.
